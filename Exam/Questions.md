# Questions

*Why where operating systems developed initially?*

OSs where initially developed to manage computer hardware, facilitayte user interaction, and maximize resource utilization through automated processes like batch processing


*How did the features of operating systems evolve along with the development of the available hardware?*

As hardware evovled, so did OS features: 
- **Integrated circuits** led to multi-programming capabilities
- **Advances in memory** enabled complexm memory management
- **Improved I/O technology** introduced efficient handling of peripheral devices
- **Microprocressors** made personal computing and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) possible
- **Networking advancements** necessitated features for network management and security


*How do we define the term "operating system" today?*

Today, an OS is a system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing services for computer programs. It offers functionalities like file and memory management, process scheduling, and user interfaces, adapting to support advancements in technology and user needs.


*What are the building blocks of a computer system?*

The fundamental building blocks of a computer system include:

1. CPU: Brain of the computer, executing program instructions and managing the operations of other components
2. Memory: Stores data and program instructions temporarily for quick access by the CPU
3. Storage: Provides long-term data storage, such as HDs and SSDs
4. I/O devices: Include things like the keyboard, mouse, monitors, etc that allow interaction with the computer
5. Motherboard: Connects all the components of the computer, allowing them to communicate with one another


*Which resources are represented by these building blocks?*

- CPU: Represents computational power and procesing resources
- Memory: Represents temporary storage capacity for immediate data processing and access
- Storage: Represents permanent data retention and retrieval capabilities
- I/O devices: Represnet user interface and external communication capabilities
- Motherboard: Represents data pathways and connectivity between components


*How does code (in the OS) interact with hardware resources?*

The OS interacts with hardware resources primarily through a component known as the kernel, which includes various drivers that act as translators between the software and the hardware. For instance

- Device Drivers: Software interfaces that control and manage the operations of specific hardware devices.
- System Calls: Requests made by running applications to the OS for performing tasks that require access to hardware resources
- Interrupts: Signals sent by hardware devices to the CPU, requesting immediate attention and response


*What are the most relevant developments in computer architecture of the last decades and which problems/benefits are related to these developments?*

1. Multi-core and Many-core Processors: 
    - Problem: Increased complexity in software to efficiently utilize multiple cores
    - Benefit: Enhanced performance and energy efficiency by allowing paralell processing og tasks
2. SSDs
    - Problem: Higher cost per gigabyte compared to traditional HDs
    - Benefit: Drastically improved data access speeds and durability
3. Virtualization
    - Problem: Can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
    - Benefit: Allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, improving resouce utilization and system scalability
4. Cloud computing 
    - Problem: Raises concerns about data security and privacy
    - Benefit: Provides flexible, scalable access to computing resources and storage, reducing the need for expensive local hardware and maintenance
5. Quantum Computing (Emerging)
    - Problem: Still in experimental stages with practical applications yet to be widely implemented
    - Benefit: Promises significant breakthroughs in solving complex computational problems that are infeasible for classical computers
