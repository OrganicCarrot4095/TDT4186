### FILES

- **File**: A fundamental unit of data storage, a file is an array of persistent bytes that systems can read from and write to. It represents a durable collection of data that remains stored across sessions.

- **File System (FS)**: 
    - The file system encompasses a collection of files and specifies how these files are organized, stored, and accessed on physical storage devices.
    - The term also refers to the component of the operating system (OS) tasked with managing these files.
    - Examples of file systems include FAT, exFAT, ext, and APFS, each with its own structure and management logic.

- Files are identified by **names** to allow programs to select and manipulate them effectively. These names can be:
    - **inode**: The low-level, system-internal identifier for a file, known as an index node.
    - **path**: A human-readable identifier that specifies the location of a file within the directory structure.
    - **file descriptor**: A runtime identifier that represents an open file within a process.

#### INODES
- Each file in a filesystem is uniquely associated with an inode number, serving as its system-level identifier.
- Inodes are unique within a filesystem at any given time, though their numbers may be reused after files are deleted.
- The `stat` command is commonly used to display inode information for a file.

#### PATH
- While inodes provide a unique system-level identification for files, remembering numerical identifiers is impractical for human users.
- Paths offer a more user-friendly naming scheme, translating to inode numbers through path-to-inode mappings stored within directories.
- A directory, itself a special type of file, contains a list of path-inode pairs, enabling the hierarchical organization of files.

#### FILE DESCRIPTOR
- File descriptors abstract the process of file access further, allowing for efficient file operations without repeatedly traversing the file system structure.
- Upon opening a file, the system performs the necessary path traversal once, then associates the file's inode with a file descriptor in memory.
- This descriptor, an integer value, serves as a handle through which the process can perform read and write operations, tracking the current offset within the file.

#### FILE API
- The File API includes essential functions for file manipulation, such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`, facilitating the creation, access, modification, and deletion of files.
- `open()` initializes access to a file and returns a file descriptor that represents the open file in subsequent operations.
- `dup()` allows for the duplication of file descriptors, enabling multiple handles on the same underlying file.
- `read()` and `write()` operations move data between the process's memory and the file.
- `lseek()` adjusts the current file offset, allowing for non-sequential read and write operations.
- `fsync()` forces the system to flush buffered data to disk, ensuring data durability.
- `close()` terminates the association between a file descriptor and its file, freeing resources for other uses.

#### MANAGING FILES
- **Deleting Files**: Files are effectively removed from the filesystem when all references to their inodes are deleted (`unlink()`) and all open file descriptors are closed.
- **Renaming Files**: The `rename()` function changes a file's path without altering its inode, enabling efficient name changes and relocations within the filesystem hierarchy.
